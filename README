Casino Application
Filip Kulig


Casino Application is simple PHP based application. The idea behind this app can be divided into two separate stages.

CORE, business logic is completely separated from PHP framework, in this case Lumen.
Business logic of the application was written in TTD manner, using clean architecture approach.
Because of this the business logic is separated, very well tested and framework independent.

In bigger application this approach can ensure us that solution will be always working.

What did went well.
	- Clean architecture and TTD.
		It has helped me to write code quickly. Code is open to new modification, and that can be introduced quickly, because of high code test coverage.
	- Google maps integration.
		Google maps code is simple, and open to further modifications.
	- Lumen as a external library dependencies
		I've used lumen to provide a connection to business logic and external world ( DB and geo localisation API )


What I'am unsure about:
	- Lumen
		I'd don't like how lumen is build and his lack of documentation, despite the fact that some part are well written. Lumen was a poor choose, I should have chosen the framework that I'm familiar with.

What did not went well:
	- Because I've chosen the Lumen as a framework, I didn't finish all requested requirements.
	- Missing requirement:
		- Authorisation, right now application is open to everybody.
		- Opening times are not implemented.

	If I would have chosen different, but familiar framework I would complete full test in less time.
